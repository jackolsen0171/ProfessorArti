# Professor Arti - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Professor Arti is an interactive knowledge visualization and chat platform that combines visual graph-based exploration with AI-powered conversational interfaces. Users can navigate through interconnected knowledge networks represented as interactive D3.js force-directed graphs, then engage in contextual conversations with AI personas representing different "professors" or knowledge domains.

## Project Vision

Create an intuitive platform where complex knowledge networks become visually explorable and conversationally accessible, bridging the gap between visual data exploration and natural language interaction.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Students & Researchers**: Need to explore complex academic topics and get detailed explanations
- **Knowledge Workers**: Want to understand interconnected concepts in their field
- **Educators**: Looking to create engaging, interactive learning experiences

### Secondary Users
- **Content Creators**: Building educational materials with interactive elements
- **Consultants**: Need to quickly understand and explain complex domain knowledge

## Core Features

### 1. Interactive Knowledge Graph Visualization
- **D3.js force-directed graph** showing interconnected concepts/entities
- **Dynamic node sizing** based on importance/relevance metrics
- **Smooth zoom and pan** interactions for graph exploration
- **Color-coded categories** for different knowledge domains
- **Clickable nodes** that trigger navigation to detailed views

### 2. Contextual AI Chat Interface  
- **Professor personas** representing different knowledge domains
- **Context-aware conversations** based on selected graph nodes
- **Multi-turn dialogue** with conversation history
- **File upload capability** for document ingestion and analysis
- **Real-time responses** with typing indicators and smooth UX

### 3. Navigation & Routing
- **Graph view** (`/`) as the main landing page
- **Chat interface** (`/chatbot/:professorId`) for focused conversations
- **Seamless transitions** between graph exploration and chat

### 4. Data Integration Layer
- **ChromaDB integration** for vector storage and semantic search
- **Document processing pipeline** for uploaded files
- **Dynamic graph data updates** based on user interactions

## Technical Architecture

### Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, React Router DOM 6.22.3
- **Visualization**: D3.js 7.9.0
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB 3.0.14
- **HTTP Client**: Axios 1.7.9
- **Build System**: Create React App (CRA) 5.0.1

### Key Components
- `App.js`: Main routing and application structure
- `ProfessorGraph.js`: D3.js visualization component with force simulation
- `Chat.js`: Conversational interface with professor personas
- `FileUpload.js`: Document ingestion functionality
- `Home.js`: Landing page and graph container

## User Journey

### Primary Flow
1. **Land on graph view** - User sees visual representation of knowledge network
2. **Explore connections** - Click and drag nodes, zoom to explore relationships  
3. **Select topic of interest** - Click on specific node/professor to dive deeper
4. **Engage in conversation** - Navigate to chat interface for that topic/professor
5. **Upload documents** - Add new knowledge sources to expand the graph
6. **Return to exploration** - Navigate back to graph with updated/enriched data

### Secondary Flows
- **Direct chat access** - Users can bookmark specific professor chat URLs
- **File-first interaction** - Upload documents first, then explore generated graph
- **Search-driven discovery** - Find specific concepts through conversational queries

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- **Session duration** on graph visualization
- **Node interaction rate** (clicks, drags, zooms per session)
- **Chat conversation depth** (messages per conversation thread)
- **Return user rate** for continued exploration

### Educational Effectiveness  
- **Knowledge retention** through pre/post interaction assessments
- **User satisfaction** with explanation quality and graph usefulness
- **Task completion rate** for research/learning objectives

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Graph rendering** must handle 500+ nodes smoothly at 60fps
- **Chat responses** should appear within 2 seconds of user input
- **File upload processing** should provide progress feedback for files >10MB

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard navigation** for graph elements and chat interface
- **Screen reader compatibility** with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Color contrast compliance** with WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Scalability
- **Database optimization** for fast semantic search queries
- **Component architecture** supporting easy addition of new professor personas
- **Asset optimization** for fast initial load times

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- **Collaborative exploration** - Multiple users exploring the same graph simultaneously
- **Custom graph creation** - Users can build their own knowledge networks
- **Advanced analytics** - Track learning paths and knowledge gap identification
- **Mobile responsiveness** - Touch-optimized graph interactions

### Integration Opportunities
- **LMS integration** - Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard compatibility
- **Academic databases** - PubMed, ArXiv, Google Scholar connectors  
- **Export functionality** - Save conversations and graph states
- **API endpoints** - Allow third-party integrations

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **D3.js performance** with large datasets may require optimization
- **ChromaDB scaling** might need database architecture changes
- **Browser compatibility** issues with advanced D3 features

### Product Risks  
- **Learning curve** for users unfamiliar with graph-based interfaces
- **Content quality** depends heavily on AI model performance
- **User adoption** requires clear value proposition demonstration

## Dependencies

### External Services
- **AI/LLM API** for conversational capabilities (implementation pending)
- **File processing services** for document parsing and analysis
- **Vector embedding services** for semantic search functionality

### Internal Dependencies
- **Graph data pipeline** for converting documents to graph structures
- **Professor persona system** for contextual AI responses
- **Authentication system** for user sessions and data persistence
