## Session Summary - Apple Calendar Integration + Tailwind CSS v4 Complete

### Major Accomplishments
- **Apple Calendar Integration**: Full implementation using AppleScript with run-applescript library
  - Created backend/services/calendar.js with getCalendars(), createEvent(), getUpcomingEvents(), createEventFromAI()
  - Added REST API endpoints in backend/routes/calendar.js (GET /calendars, POST /events, POST /extract-events)
  - Fixed timezone issues by using ISO format dates and component-based AppleScript date construction
  - Resolved ChromaDB document retrieval for AI-powered date extraction from uploaded syllabi
  - Successfully tested end-to-end workflow: upload document → extract dates → create calendar events

- **Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration**: Complete setup using CRACO
  - Created craco.config.js to override Create React App webpack configuration
  - Updated package.json scripts to use CRACO (start, build, test)
  - Configured postcss.config.js with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
  - Updated src/index.css to v4 import syntax: @import 'tailwindcss'
  - Enhanced tailwind.config.js with McGill University brand colors and Professor Arti customizations
  - Successfully resolved CRA + Tailwind v4 compatibility issues

### Technical Decisions Made
- Used AppleScript over EventKit for broader calendar app compatibility
- Implemented CRACO instead of ejecting from Create React App
- Created comprehensive error handling for date formatting edge cases
- Added McGill brand colors: mcgill-red (#ed1944), mcgill-forest (#2d5016), graph-node, calendar-green
- Established timezone-safe date handling pattern: ${date}T12:00:00 for dateless events

### Current Status
- Apple Calendar integration: ✅ COMPLETE AND TESTED
- Tailwind CSS v4: ✅ COMPLETE AND COMPILING
- Application running successfully at http://localhost:8000
- Both backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 8000) operational

### Next Priority - User Explicit Request
User stated: 'fully configure v4, the whole codebase should be styled with tailwind'
- Apply Tailwind styling throughout Professor Arti components
- Utilize new McGill University brand colors and custom animations
- Style ProfessorGraph.js, Chat.js, ChatBot.js, Home.js with Tailwind classes
- Implement responsive design patterns using Tailwind utilities

### Status: Ready for comprehensive Tailwind styling phase
