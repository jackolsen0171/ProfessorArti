## UI/UX Pivot Decision - 2025-01-11

### **Strategic Pivot: Dashboard-First Design**
The application is pivoting from a graph-centric design to a task/calendar-focused dashboard:

**Previous Focus**: Knowledge graph as the main interface
**New Focus**: Student productivity dashboard with integrated AI support

### **New Information Architecture**
1. **Main Dashboard** (Primary View)
   - Welcome message with personalized greeting
   - Todo list based on McGill calendar events
   - Upcoming assignments and deadlines
   - Quick access to professors and courses
   - Calendar integration for academic events

2. **Professor Chat** (Secondary View)
   - Context-aware conversations based on current coursework
   - Smart suggestions for upcoming assignments
   - Integrated with todo list and calendar

3. **Knowledge Graph** (Tertiary Feature)
   - Moved to secondary navigation
   - Accessible via menu or quick action
   - Simplified visualization for professor connections

### **Rationale for Pivot**
- Better aligns with student daily workflow
- Prioritizes actionable tasks over exploration
- Maintains AI chat as core feature while adding practical utility
- Graph visualization preserved but de-emphasized

## Next Development Priorities

### **Phase 2: Dashboard Implementation**
1. **Dashboard UI Development**
   - Task list component with McGill calendar integration
   - Professor cards with quick chat access
   - Course overview with deadlines
   - Responsive grid layout with Tailwind CSS

2. **Calendar Integration Enhancement**
   - Sync with McGill academic calendar
   - Parse and display assignments/exams
   - Smart task generation from calendar events
   - Due date tracking and notifications

3. **Professor List Refactor**
   - Compact card view with avatars
   - Office hours integration
   - Quick chat launcher
   - Course association display

### **Phase 3: Production (Future)**
1. **Deployment Pipeline** - CI/CD setup
2. **Monitoring & Analytics** - Production observability
3. **Security Hardening** - Authentication and authorization
4. **Scalability** - Multi-user support
